- **Previous/Next Month**: Gray-out days from adjacent months for context

### 2. View Toggle
- **Calendar View**: The new grid calendar view
- **List View**: The original list view (still available)

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Create event from calendar grid
- [ ] Create event from "New Event" button
- [ ] View event details by clicking event
- [ ] Edit event from sidebar
- [ ] Delete event from sidebar
- [ ] Navigate between months
- [ ] Jump to today
- [ ] Toggle between calendar and list views
- [ ] Test with no events
- [ ] Test with multiple events on same day
- [ ] Test with events spanning multiple months
- [ ] Test keyboard navigation
- [ ] Test dark mode
- [ ] Test responsive behavior

### Edge Cases to Test
- Events at midnight
- Events spanning multiple days
- Very long event titles
- Many attendees
- Empty event fields
- Different timezones
- Past events vs future events

## Integration with Backend

The calendar works with the existing backend API:
- `GET /calendar/events` - Fetch events
- `POST /calendar/events` - Create event
- `PUT /calendar/events/{id}` - Update event
- `DELETE /calendar/events/{id}` - Delete event

All API calls are handled through the existing `mailmateAPI` service.

## Conclusion

The new calendar view provides a professional, Google Calendar-like experience while maintaining compatibility with the existing backend and design system. The implementation is fully accessible, responsive, and ready for production use.
