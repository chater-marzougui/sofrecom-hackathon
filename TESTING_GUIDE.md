## API Endpoint Testing

### Test Backend Connectivity
```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:5000/health

# Get root info
curl http://localhost:5000/
```

### Test Email Processing
```bash
# Process email
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/ai/process \
  -F "email_text=Test email content"

# Chat
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/ai/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"history": [], "user_input": "What is this email about?", "context": "Test email"}'

# Translate
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/ai/translate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text": "Hello", "target_language": "French"}'

# Detect tasks
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/ai/detect-tasks \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email_text": "Please send the report by Friday"}'
```

### Test Agent Endpoints
```bash
# Run agent
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/agent/run \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"prompt": "Summarize this email and suggest next steps", "context": "Email content here"}'

# Run advanced agent
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/agent/run-advanced \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"prompt": "Complex task here", "validate": true, "return_plan": true}'
```

### Test Attachment Endpoints
```bash
# Query attachment (requires base64 encoded file)
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/attachments/query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"filename": "test.pdf", "query": "What is in this document?", "file_content_base64": "..."}'

# Smart query
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/attachments/smart-query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"filename": "data.xlsx", "query": "What is the sum of column A?", "file_content_base64": "..."}'
```

## Known Limitations

1. **Thread Attachment Content Fetching:**
   - UI shows thread attachments but can't query them directly
   - Would require backend endpoint to fetch attachment content from Gmail
   - Currently shows informative message to users
   - Manual upload works as workaround

2. **Real Gmail Integration:**
   - Reply functionality creates local reply for demonstration
   - Full Gmail API integration requires backend enhancement
   - Email sending would need Gmail API connection

3. **Attachment Size Limits:**
   - Large files may cause performance issues
   - Consider adding file size validation

## Performance Considerations

- Toast notifications auto-dismiss to prevent clutter
- Quick action results auto-hide after 5 seconds
- Loading states prevent multiple simultaneous requests
- Thread refresh is manual to avoid unnecessary API calls

## Security Considerations

- All API calls include error handling
- File uploads validate file types
- Input sanitization on backend (already implemented)
- No credentials stored in frontend
- Context passed securely to backend

## Accessibility

- All buttons have aria-labels
- Loading states clearly indicated
- Error messages are descriptive
- Keyboard navigation supported (Enter to send, etc.)
- Color contrast meets standards

## Browser Compatibility

Tested on:
- Chrome/Edge (Chromium-based)
- Firefox
- Safari

Required features:
- ES6+ JavaScript support
- Fetch API
- CSS Grid and Flexbox
- CSS Animations

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Actions not working
- Check backend is running on port 5000
- Check CORS settings in backend
- Verify API_BASE_URL in mailmateApi.ts

### Issue: Toasts not appearing  
- Verify ToastProvider wraps App in main.tsx
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify useToast hook is imported correctly

### Issue: Threads not loading
- Check backend email database connection
- Verify /emails/threads endpoint
- Check browser network tab for errors

### Issue: File upload fails
- Verify file type is supported
- Check file size (shouldn't be too large)
- Check backend attachment endpoint

## Next Steps

1. **Backend Enhancements:**
   - Add endpoint to fetch attachment content from Gmail
   - Implement real Gmail API reply functionality
   - Add email thread polling/webhooks for real-time updates

2. **Frontend Improvements:**
   - Add attachment preview in thread view
   - Implement draft auto-save
   - Add keyboard shortcuts
   - Improve mobile responsiveness

3. **Testing:**
   - Add unit tests for components
   - Add integration tests for API calls
   - Add E2E tests for critical flows
   - Performance testing with large datasets

## Success Criteria

✅ All phases implemented
✅ No TypeScript compilation errors
✅ All tools connected to correct backend endpoints
✅ Toast notifications working across all components
✅ Error handling provides clear user feedback
✅ Loading states prevent confusion
✅ UI updates reflect backend responses
✅ Quick actions provide convenient shortcuts
✅ Thread context shared between views
✅ Attachment handling working (with noted limitations)

## Conclusion

The frontend-backend integration has been successfully completed with all planned features implemented. The application now provides a cohesive user experience with proper feedback, error handling, and state management. Users can interact with emails through multiple interfaces (thread viewer, chat, quick actions) with consistent behavior and clear feedback throughout their workflow.
